GEOG5995M Assessment 1. Agent-Based Model practicals code

This is the repository for the code of the Agent-Based Model (AMB) built up in the practicals of the module GEOG5995M Programming for Social Science: Core Skills. 
The model was built up in Python (programming language) and it is a simple but complete AMB. 
To picture it as a real-life process, the agents can be imagined as sheep wandering around an environment (meadow) and nibbling away data (grass). In this way, the sheep interact with the environment (feeding from it) and with each other (checking that there are no others in their environment). 
The graphs plotted by the code show the gradual erosion of data through the random movement of agents which to understand the simulation. 
To run the model three files are necessary: the model.py, the agentclasses.py and the in.txt. 
The code has been appropriately licensed.
